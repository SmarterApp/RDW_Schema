-- Fix the claim data order for ELA

-- The data order for ELA scorable claims has been Reading, Listening, Writing, Research.
-- The middle two need to be flipped so it is Reading, Writing, Listening, Research.
-- Because claims are denormalized in the reporting database we have to update asmt and exam.
