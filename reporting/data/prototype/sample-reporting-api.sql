-- Below are sample of simplified queries, they need to be further developed during API/UI development

-- Assumptions:
-- 1. Data Mart has only active groups. Migrate will have to take care of it
-- 2. Groups that have no students with the exams will still be in the data mart.
-- 3. Only students with the exams will be in the data mart student_group_membership table.

-- TODOs:
--   decide how to handle 'ids to names' translation. Probably better to do it in Java
--   decide how to populate the filters on the screen? In java?
--   indexes
--   group subject restriction - do we want/need to have it in the SQL or can the app provide it? Note that some SQL have asmt ids that implicitly means a subject
