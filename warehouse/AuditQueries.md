# Auditing
This document describes auditing in RDW and provides sample queries for analysing audit data.

## Intended Audience
The intended audience should be familiar with database technology and querying a database with SQL.
- **System and Database Administrators**: This document provides administrators information on what is audited in the warehouse and where it is stored.
- **Developers and Analysts**: Developers and analysts with knowledge of SQL and the appropriate permissions can use this document as a guide to querying exam and student modifications.

## Terminology
- **Test Result**: When a student takes a test the results are transmitted to the data warehouse.  This submission is a test result.  It is for one instance of a student taking a given test.
- **TRT**: Is an acronym for an instance of a test result in the Smarter Balanced [Test Results Transmission Format](http://www.smarterapp.org/specs/TestResultsTransmissionFormat.html) where the content adheres to the [Test Results Data Model](http://www.smarterapp.org/news/2015/08/26/DataModelAndSamples.html)
- **Exam**: Each test result submitted or migrated from legacy data is stored as an exam in the data warehouse.
- **warehouse schema**: The warehouse schema is the source of truth for reporting in the data warehouse and is used to populate user reporting and analytical reporting schemas. All schemas are defined in the [SmarterApp/RDW_Schema](https://github.com/SmarterApp/RDW_Schema) repository.  The warehouse schema is in the [SmarterApp/RDW_Schema/warehouse](https://github.com/SmarterApp/RDW_Schema/tree/develop/warehouse) folder.
- **Entity State**: Auditing tracks changes.
  - **Create**: A new entity such as an exam is added to the warehouse.  This is not audited, however, there is an import record that records attributes of the submission.
  - **Update**: A request to change a previously created entity.  This is audited as an update.
  - **Delete**: An entity is removed from the warehouse.  Does not occur for entities being audited such as exam.  Does occur for entity attributes stored in supporting child tables and is audited as a delete.
  - **Soft Delete**: A request to delete an entity from the warehouse that is being audited is updated with it's deleted flag set to true.  This is audited as an update.
- **Modification**: update, delete and soft delete state changes
- **Import**:  All inflows of data to the warehouse create an import record that stores attributes of the inflow including a timestamp and the authorized user.
  

## What is audited?
The warehouse audits entity state changes for exams and student information.

Warehouse Exam Tables:

| Table                        | Description                                 | Entity Type | States                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| exam                         | One record per test result                  | Parent      | Create, Update, Soft Delete |
| exam_available_accommodation | One record per exam available accommodation | Child       | Create, Delete              |
| exam_claim_score             | One record per exam claim                   | Child       | Create, Update              |
| exam_item                    | One record per exam item                    | Child       | Create, Update, Delete      |


## Where is audit data stored?
Each exam table has an 'audit_...' table that records the state change for each row.  The audit tables contain the state of the row before the change.
In addition to the columns from the table being audited, each audit_ table has the following columns:

- **id**: Unique ID
- **action**: delete or update
- **audited**: timestamp when the audit record was created
- **database_user**: The 'username'@'hostname' of the database user connected to the database.

The Ingest Event column is the normal application flow for loading data into the warehouse where events are recorded.  Create is not recorded, instead, queries combining the the audit_ table and the table being audited can represent a complete audit trail.

MySQL triggers are used to capture audit_ records.  Each table being audited has update and delete triggers providing a record of changes made by normal application flow and manual modifications if they occur.  

| Audit Table                        | Audits                       | Ingest Event                   |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| audit_exam                         | exam                         | Update, Soft Delete(as update) |
| audit_exam_available_accommodation | exam_available_accommodation | Delete                         |
| audit_exam_claim_score             | exam_claim_score             | Update, Delete                 |
| audit_exam_item                    | exam_item                    | Update, Delete                 |

## How can audit data be queried?
Sample queries are provided for analysing audit data combining the warehouse import table, the table being audited, the audit_ table and joining other relations in the warehouse for lookup values.

### Exam

**Finding modifications to a students exams**
The following query outputs one row for each modified exam for one student.  It includes the count of modifications and the date of the last change.

The where clause can be changed to include multiple students.

```mysql
SELECT
  s.ssid,
  CONCAT(s.last_or_surname, ', ', first_name) student,
  e.id exam_id,
  e.oppId,
  e.opportunity,
  asmt.name assessment_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN ae.exam_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) exam_update_count,
  MAX(ae.audited) last_update
FROM exam e
LEFT JOIN audit_exam ae ON e.id = ae.exam_id
JOIN student s ON e.student_id = s.id
JOIN asmt ON e.asmt_id = asmt.id
WHERE ae.exam_id IS NOT NULL
 AND e.student_id IN ( SELECT id FROM student WHERE ssid = 'SSID001')
GROUP BY e.id
```

**Finding modifications to exams in a date range**
The following query outputs one row for each modification to an exam within a date range.

**Accommodation audit trail for exams**
Each child table audit trail can be queried in a similar manner.  The following example is for the exam_available_accommodation child table.

The query can be modified to display different or all columns.  The where clause can be modified, such as, to include multiple exams or all exams for a student.
