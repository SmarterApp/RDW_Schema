## Prerequisites
Admin queries refer to tables by their object ID (OID). You can get this OID in multiple ways, below is one of them:
```sql
SELECT oid, relname FROM pg_class WHERE relname='your_table_name_here';
```

### Admin schema
Create admin schema in the Amazon Redshift cluster database you’re optimizing.

####  V_EXTENDED_TABLE_INFO view
Add a new view, named v_extended_table_info, from [here](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils/blob/master/src/AdminViews/v_extended_table_info.sql).
This is an improved version of the system view, which offers an extended output that makes schema and workload reviews much more efficient.
This view is used to estimate the table significance during the optimization process. 
The scan frequency and table size are the two metrics most relevant in that regards.
```sql
select *  from admin.v_extended_table_info where tablename = 'your_table_name_here';
```

####  WLM adming views

The following views help with understanding of the behavior of queue processing in Amazon Redshift.
##### WLM_QUEUE_STATE_VW view
```sql
create view admin.WLM_QUEUE_STATE_VW as
select (config.service_class-5) as queue
, trim (class.condition) as description
, config.num_query_tasks as slots
, config.query_working_mem as mem
, config.max_execution_time as max_time
, config.user_group_wild_card as "user_*"
, config.query_group_wild_card as "query_*"
, state.num_queued_queries queued
, state.num_executing_queries executing
, state.num_executed_queries executed
from
STV_WLM_CLASSIFICATION_CONFIG class,
STV_WLM_SERVICE_CLASS_CONFIG config,
STV_WLM_SERVICE_CLASS_STATE state
where
class.action_service_class = config.service_class 
and class.action_service_class = state.service_class 
and config.service_class > 4
order by config.service_class;
```

##### WLM_QUERY_STATE_VW View
```sql
create view admin.WLM_QUERY_STATE_VW as
select query, (service_class-5) as queue, slot_count, trim(wlm_start_time) as start_time, trim(state) as state, trim(queue_time) as queue_time, trim(exec_time) as exec_time
from stv_wlm_query_state;
```

### Troubleshooting by scenarios

##### Scenario: “There are no specific reports of slowness, but I want to ensure I’m getting the most out of my cluster by performing a review on all tables.”
Returns table information for all scanned tables
```sql 
SELECT * FROM admin.v_extended_table_info 
WHERE table_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT tbl FROM stl_scan WHERE type=2 
)ORDER BY SPLIT_PART("scans:rr:filt:sel:del",':',1)::int DESC,  size DESC; 
```

##### Scenario: “The query with ID 4941313 is slow.”
```sql 
 Returns table information for all tables scanned by query 4941313
SELECT * FROM admin.v_extended_table_info 
WHERE table_id IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT tbl FROM stl_scan WHERE type=2 AND query = 4941313
) ORDER BY SPLIT_PART("scans:rr:filt:sel:del",':',1)::int DESC,  size DESC; 
```

##### Explain plan alerts

```sql 
SELECT
  trim(s.perm_table_name)                                                                                                                                         AS table,

                                                                              ELSE coalesce(b.starttime, d.starttime, s.starttime) END))) / 60) :: NUMERIC(24, 0) AS minutes,

  trim(split_part(l.event, ':', 1))                                                                                                                               AS event,
  substring(trim(l.solution), 1, 60)                                                                                                                              AS solution,
  max(l.query)                                                                                                                                                    AS sample_query,
